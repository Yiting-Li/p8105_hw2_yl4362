## Problem 1

**Read and clean the data in Mr. Trash Wheel sheet**

``` r
mr_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
    range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(dumpster > 0) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

**Read and clean the data in Precipitation 2017 and 2018 sheets**

``` r
precipitation_2017_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2017")

precipitation_2018_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2018")

precipitation_combined_df =
  rbind(precipitation_2017_df, precipitation_2018_df)

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precipitation_combined_df = 
  left_join(precipitation_combined_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

**Datasets description**

In the `mr_trashwheel_df` dataset, there are 344 observations and 14
variables. This dataset describes the dumpsters number, the trush types
they collected, their corresponding volume collected, and the time they
were recorded.

In the `precipitation_combined_df` dataset, there are 24 observations
and 4 variables. This dataset describes the precipitation in different
months over the year of 2017 to 2018.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

## Problem 2

**Read and clean the NYC transit data**

``` r
nyc_transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

**Dataset description**

The dataset `nyc_transit_df` contains the NYC subway stations’ name,
latitude, longitude, line, routes served there, entrance and vending,
and ADA compliance.

I cleaned the variable names into a uniform style, selected the
essential variables about stations and routes, and converted the
variable `entry` from character into logical.

I think the current dataset is still not tidy because the variable
`vending` is stored as character although its values are logical: `YES`,
`NO`.

**Reformat data and answers for statistical questions**

``` r
distinct_station = distinct(nyc_transit_df, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

vending_false = filter(nyc_transit_df, vending == 'NO')
```

1.  There are 465 distinct stations.

2.  84 stations are ADA compliant.

3.  The proportion of station entrances without vending allow entrance
    is 0.3770492. The proportion of station exits without vending allow
    entrance is0.6229508

**A train**

``` r
a_station = 
  filter(distinct_station, route1 == 'A' | route2 == 'A' | route3 == 'A' | route4 == 'A' | route5 == 'A' | route6 == 'A' | route7 == 'A' | route8 == 'A' | route9 == 'A' | route10 == 'A' | route11 == 'A')
```

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train.

Of the stations that serve the A train, there are 17 stations are ADA
compliant.

## Problem 3

**Read, clean and merge the FiveThirtyEight data**

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), 
         month = as.integer(month), 
         day = as.integer(day),
         month = month.abb[month],
         president = case_when(
           prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
           prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")
         ) %>%
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)

snp_df =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, sep = "/", into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), 
         month = as.integer(month), 
         day = as.integer(day),
         month = month.abb[month]) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  relocate(year, month)

unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment_percent"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))

pols_snp = 
  full_join(
    pols_month_df, snp_df, by = c("year","month")
  )

unemployment_pols_snp = 
  full_join(
    unemployment_df, pols_snp, by = c("year","month")
  )
```
